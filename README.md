<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites (develop version)

GrandNode requires .NET Core 9.0, MongoDB 4.0+, and OS-specific dependency tools. 

### Installation

GrandNode can be installed in a few different ways. Note: The develop branch is the development version of GrandNode and it may be unstable. The main branch is the primary branch that contains the latest stable version. You can also download specific stable versions from the Releases page or switch to a release branch.

* Docker 
```bash
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo 
docker run -d -p 80:8080 --name grandnode2 --link mongodb:mongo -v grandnode_images:/app/wwwroot/assets/images -v grandnode_appdata:/app/App_Data grandnode/grandnode2
``` 
If you want to download the latest stable version of GrandNode please use the following command, where x.xx is a number of GrandNode release: 
```bash
docker pull grandnode/grandnode2:x.xx 
```

* Open locally with VS2022+ (v17.12.0) or above

Run the project in the Visual Studio 2022+, extract the source code package downloaded from Releases tab to a folder. Enter the extracted folder and double-click the GrandNode.sln solution file. Select the Plugins project, rebuild it, then select the GrandNode.Web project.

* Host on Linux server 

Before you start - please install, configure the nginx server, .NET Core 9.0+ and MongoDB 4.0+
```bash
mkdir ~/source
cd ~/source
git clone - b x.xx https://github.com/grandnode/grandnode2.git
```
```bash
cd ~/source/grandnode
dotnet restore GrandNode.sln
```
Now it's time to rebuild all of our plugins and publish application (command is pretty long because we've combined all commands in a single line, to ease up your work):
```bash
sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Authentication.Facebook && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Authentication.Google && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/DiscountRules.Standard && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/ExchangeRate.McExchange && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Payments.BrainTree && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Payments.CashOnDelivery && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Payments.StripeCheckout && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Shipping.ByWeight && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Shipping.FixedRateShipping && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Shipping.ShippingPoint && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Tax.CountryStateZip && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Tax.FixedRate && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Widgets.FacebookPixel && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Widgets.GoogleAnalytics && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Widgets.Slider && sudo dotnet build src/Plugins/Theme.Modern && sudo dotnet publish src/Web/Grand.Web -c Release -o /var/webapps/grandnode 
```
Optional: Create the service file, to automatically restart your application.
```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/grandnode.service
```
Paste the following content, and save changes:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=GrandNode

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/var/webapps/grandnode
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dotnet /var/webapps/grandnode/Grand.Web.dll
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
SyslogIdentifier=dotnet-grandnode
User=www-data
Environment=ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Enable the service and restart the GrandNode
```
sudo systemctl enable grandnode.service
sudo systemctl start grandnode.service
```
